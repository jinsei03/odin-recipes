    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spam musubi is a popular snack in Hawaii. It is a type of sushi that features marinated cooked Spam and rice wrapped with nori. I got this recipe from a local Hawaiian friend when I was living there.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) container fully cooked luncheon meat (such as Spam)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>5 sheets sushi nori (dry seaweed)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Soak uncooked rice in water to cover for 4 hours; drain and rinse.</li>
        <li>Bring 2 cups water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove pan from heat and stir in rice vinegar. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Stir sugar, soy sauce, and oyster sauce together in a medium bowl until sugar is completely dissolved.</li>
        <li>Slice luncheon meat lengthwise into 10 slices, or to desired thickness, and marinate in sauce for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook slices until lightly browned, about 2 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Cut nori sheets in half and lay on a flat work surface.</li>
        <li>Place a rice press in the center of a sheet, and press rice tightly inside.</li>
        <li>Top with a slice of luncheon meat, and remove press.</li>
        <li>Wrap nori around rice, sealing edges with a small amount of water. (Rice may also be formed by hand in the shape of the meat slices and about 1-inch thick.)</li>
        <li>Serve musubi warm or chilled.</li>
    </ol>
